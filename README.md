# Script to hold down W key in game

Sometimes in game we need to hold down W key for a long time but not much usage of A/S/D. If you are lazy like me, you can use this script to hold down and release W key whenever required.

**Version 1.0**

The original target of this script is Wot Blitz (Windows 10) but it can be used with any other games with little bit of modifications.
